#sets are basically unorderdit ,it didnt follow indexing ,it have no duplicates, it is only in curely brackets  {}
#there is only one method to create the empty sets. and it changable and the values under the sets are unchangable.



'''a={4,4,7,9,9,13}
print(type(a))
'''
a={4,4,7,9,9,13}
#print(type(a))
#with the help of . operator we can use method.

#add method :-  it is to add the value

'''a.add(55)
print(a)
'''
#differnce method:-  what are the values are diffrent in a from b will printed.
 a={10,20,30,40,50}
 
     #differnce update:-  the values will  be updated in a 


#discard :- if it is use to remove the value if exist it will not going to show you the error

#remove:-  if it is use to remove the value if exist it will not going to show you the error


#intersection:-  #common elements in a and b

#intersection_update:-  to update in one


#isdisjoint:-    if any value in a and b is same, then it will return false else true

# issuperset :-  

#issuset:-    


# pop:--  it remove random element from the sets.
#union:-- it remove the duplicate parts.

#update:-  it add 

#symmetric_difference:-  it return 

#symmetric_difference-update:-
